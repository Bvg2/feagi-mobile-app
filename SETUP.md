# Welcome to the FEAGI App

## KAT INTRO ðŸ˜¸

GIT READY TO LEARN ðŸ“š Every struggle is a lesson...

This boilerplate app has been created from React Native x Expo documentation. (Expo is the standard framework for React Native.)

Let's get started!

- You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

- Run `npm install -g eas-cli`

- Sign up for a free Expo account: https://expo.dev/signup

- Run `eas login`

- Run `npm install`

- Coding for iPhone:

  - The React Native docs say that the iOS simulator requires a Mac, but you can also use an external iOS device like an iPhone. In that case, scan the QR code after running the commands in "Get started" below. If you don't have access to an Apple device, skip to "Coding for Android" below.
  - Mac: In XCode, make sure you have Command Line Tools enabled under the Locations tab
  - Mac: React Native highly recommends installing Watchman for better performance: `brew install watchman`

- Coding for Android:

  - If you don't have access to an Apple device, focus on the Android app. It may require some extra legwork, as this codebase was initialized following the iOS simulator steps. Broadly follow the [starter guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated&mode=development-build), but make sure to keep it within this unified codebase. Expo supports Android and iOS in the same codebase -- that's the beauty of React Native!

- Run `npx expo start`. In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

  - [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
  - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
  - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
  - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Start Developing

- You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

- Continue with next steps at Expo's [Start Developing](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/)

- If you prefer, you can create a simple practice app by following [this Expo guide](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/). It may be a detour, but not a bad idea if you get stuck.

- When you begin coding the app, you can learn React Native from the lovely docs: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Troubleshooting

- [Discord community](https://chat.expo.dev): Chat with Expo users and ask questions
- Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc., can be helpful in a pinch
- If you're struggling to get the initial codebase up and running, try creating a separate practice skeleton by following the [steps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) that I followed to create this codebase. You may identify some missing packages, or at least get some more context.
